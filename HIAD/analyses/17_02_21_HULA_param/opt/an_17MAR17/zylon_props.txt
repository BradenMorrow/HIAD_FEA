For the zylon laminate my inputs were:
beta = 69 deg
pressure = 12 psi
EL = 90 lb/in
GLH = 4000 lb/in
diameter = 9.6 inches
Ebladder = 54.8 lb/in
Gbladder = 19 lb/in

I obtained the following laminate properties:
EL = 90 lb/in
EH = 3600 lb/in
GLH = 4000 lb/in
nuLH = 0.147

For reference I obtained an effective fiber stiffness of 17,660 lb/in.

Let me know if I can clarify anything or run other laminate inputs.
